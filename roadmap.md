# Roadmap

## Outstanding Issues

 * Merging units should not be allowed across islands. Currently, a unit from
   one island can merge onto one from another.

## Release Plan

 * 0.2.3: Complete server-client split.
 * 0.2.4: Rewrite AI.
 * 0.2.5: Add networking.
 * 0.3.0: Stability improvements to all of the above.
